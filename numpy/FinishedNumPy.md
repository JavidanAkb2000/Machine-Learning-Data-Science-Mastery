🧠 NumPy Mastery – Zero to Mastery Exercises
This repository contains my hands-on exercises and deep-dive explorations into NumPy, completed as part of the Zero to Mastery Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp. These notebooks represent hours of independent learning, debugging, and understanding core concepts in numerical computing.

🚀 What I Did
I completed multiple structured lessons and self-guided coding challenges covering beginner to intermediate-level NumPy operations. I focused not just on syntax, but on why things work, and how they affect memory, speed, and code clarity.

📚 Topics Covered
✅ Creating and initializing arrays

✅ Understanding and using data types (dtype)

✅ Efficient array reshaping and broadcasting

✅ Generating sequences with arange, linspace, etc.

✅ Performing element-wise operations (+, -, *, /, **)

✅ Axis-based operations for row/column-wise analysis

✅ Aggregations (sum, mean, std, etc.)

✅ Random number generation for simulations

✅ Matrix multiplication using dot and matmul

🧠 Skills Gained
