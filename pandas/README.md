# 🐼 Pandas Data Analysis Exercises – Hands-On Practice Notebook

> 🔍 **“Don’t just learn Pandas. Speak its language.”**

Welcome to one of the most *brutally practical* practice sessions I’ve ever done.

This notebook isn’t just a bunch of copied cells. It’s **me wrestling with real-world DataFrame tasks** from scratch — exploring, cleaning, transforming, grouping, visualizing, and making mistakes along the way (then fixing them like a real data scientist does).

## 📘 What's Inside?

This Jupyter notebook is a **deep-dive, hands-on practice set** for mastering `pandas`, based on the Zero to Mastery Machine Learning & Data Science course. Every line was typed, tested, debugged, and understood.

### Topics Covered:

* ✅ Creating Series and DataFrames from scratch
* 🧼 Handling missing data with `.fillna()` and `.dropna()`
* 🔁 Iterating and applying logic over columns
* 📊 Creating crosstabs, groupby stats, and histograms
* 📉 Basic visualization using Matplotlib with Pandas
* 🧮 Data transformation (e.g. converting currencies, units, etc.)
* 💥 Tackling errors and deprecation warnings head-on (including the infamous chained assignment warning)

---

## ⚒️ Tools Used

* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `numpy`
* Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda

---

## 🤯 Why This Matters

Every ML or data science job asks you to:

* Load and explore messy CSVs ✅
* Handle missing data ✅
* Visualize and understand trends ✅
* Group, filter, and summarize ✅

This notebook shows I can do exactly that. **No hand-holding. Just code, logic, and results.**

## 🧠 Why You Should Care

This isn't textbook theory.

> It's proof of grind, clarity of thought, and readiness to deal with real business data.

Recruiters: if you're reading this, **I'm not afraid to go line by line, cell by cell.**
